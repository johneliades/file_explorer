#when going lower that scroll with arrows
#history back on collapsed tree buggy behaviour
#small bug requires soft refresh?: Node is created then external source makes 
		folder in it and node is clicked again so createnode is called but doesnt
		add the new node. Maybe create a garbage cleaner in createnode.
#search results make some padding between text and image
#the existence of the second panel behind wraplayout causes bug in positioning of items
		when search is running
#threaded search stops only when finished
