#better focus order
#when going lower scroll with arrows
#search broken cause of non recursive create?

#small bug requires soft refresh?: Node is created then external source makes 
		folder in it and node is clicked again so createnode is called but doesnt
		add the new node. Maybe create a garbage cleaner in createnode.
